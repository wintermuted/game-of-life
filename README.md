Conway's Game of Life
-----

[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/wintermuted/game-of-life/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wintermuted/game-of-life/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

This project is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Goals
- Provide a succinct example of my programming skill in TypeScript vis-a-vis a known programming problem.
- Demonstrate my understanding of [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).
- Provide myself an opportunity to learn HTML5 Canvas.

## Current State
- The rules of the Game of Life have been implemented.  
  - A Dictionary is used as the primary datastructure.
  - The implementation of the core logic can be found in [`packages/core/src/core/game.ts`](https://github.com/wintermuted/game-of-life/blob/master/packages/core/src/core/game.ts).
  - A class [`Game`](https://github.com/wintermuted/game-of-life/blob/master/packages/core/src/class/Game.ts) can be used to start a game and step through it.
- The game rules are backed with unit tests.
- The game has been tested with common Still Life & Oscillator patterns.
- A rudimentary UI built with React has been added, however it is poorly optimized.  A rewrite is necessary for it to be performant with larger grids.

## Architecture

This project is organized as an **NX monorepo** with TypeScript composite builds:

### Canonical App Path

- The canonical UI app is `packages/app/src/`.
- The historical top-level `src/` tree has been removed.
- Use root scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`) or Nx targets so commands resolve to `@game-of-life/app`.

### Packages

- **`@game-of-life/core`** (`packages/core/`) - Core game logic library
  - Pure TypeScript implementation of Conway's Game of Life rules
  - Game state management (Grid class)
  - Pattern definitions (oscillators, still lifes, spaceships, methuselahs)
  - Type definitions and interfaces
  - No dependencies on UI frameworks
  
- **`@game-of-life/app`** (`packages/app/`) - React UI application
  - Vite-based React application
  - Wintermuted UI theme components
  - Canvas-based grid rendering
  - Pattern selector and game controls
  - Depends on `@game-of-life/core`

### TypeScript Composite Builds

The project uses TypeScript's [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) for incremental builds:

- Root `tsconfig.json` references both packages
- `packages/core/tsconfig.json` has `composite: true` and outputs to `dist/`
- `packages/app/tsconfig.json` references the core package

This enables:
- Faster incremental builds
- Better IDE performance
- Clear dependency boundaries between packages

## Technology

- **Build System**: [NX](https://nx.dev) - Smart monorepo build system with caching
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0
- **UI Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **UI Components**: [@wintermuted/ui-theme](https://github.com/wintermuted/ui-theme)
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Bundler**: Vite

## Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install
```

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm start            # Alias for dev

# Building
npm run build        # Build all packages
npm run build:app    # Build only the app package

# Testing
npm test             # Run tests for all packages
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui      # Open Vitest UI

# Linting
npm run lint         # Lint the app package

# Preview
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### NX Commands

You can also use NX directly for more control:

```bash
# Run tasks for specific packages
npx nx run @game-of-life/core:build
npx nx run @game-of-life/core:test
npx nx run @game-of-life/app:dev

# Run tasks for all packages
npx nx run-many --target=test --all
npx nx run-many --target=build --all

# View project graph
npx nx graph
```
