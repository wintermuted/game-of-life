Conway's Game of Life
-----

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in Typescript.

## Goals
- Provide a succinct example of my programming skill in TypeScript vis-a-vis a known programming problem.
- Provide myself an opportunity to learn HTML5 Canvas.

## Current State
- The rules of the Game of Life have been implemented.  
  - A Dictionary is used as the primary datastructure.
  - A class `Game` can be used to start a game and step through it.
- The game rules are backed with unit tests.
- The game has been tested with common Still Life & Oscillator patterns.
- There is currently no UI to use the game.

## Technology

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
